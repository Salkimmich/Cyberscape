You'll find contributions from around the world by clicking around this repository, and you can simply write up an issue there's anything you'd like to see added or changed to the content.

We understand that it can be intimidating to join a new project, and we want to make the process as smooth and welcoming as possible.

We also know that open source projects thrive on community contributions, and we are grateful for any time and effort you are willing to dedicate to our project. Whether you are an experienced developer or just starting out, we welcome your contributions and ideas.
